Hello guys, today we're talking globally here, right? Today I'm going to show you how easy it is to make your sales to the whole world with Hotmart. My name is Rafaela Bai√£o, I am the marketing coordinator here at Hotmart and today's theme is about the global market. Many people dream of having an international business and today it is very possible to be successful in this area, as a businesswoman or a global entrepreneur. But just as there are many facilities, there are several factors you need to keep an eye on. For example, if you want to sell to many countries, there are numerous exchange issues that you need to pay attention to. But hey, nothing will stop you from conquering the world, right? Here at Hotmart, selling to China is like selling to your neighbor. For the person buying the product, it's like buying in their own country. The person accesses the digital product payment page, makes the purchase, and receives everything by email and in their own currency. You have support to handle all the financial issues of the country, including exchange rates and even local payment methods. Are you thinking that every country uses the same payment methods? Each country has its own payment methods, some can even be instant like Pix. The difference is that if you do not use a platform that processes your payment in the buyer's home country and converts it to the buyer's local currency, you may be missing out on quicker access to your money and still spend a lot of time working to make sure your sales comply with the country's regulations. Think about having to study how all fiscal issues work in each country with people wanting to buy a product worldwide. Complicated, right? Unless you have a huge team or Hotmart working for you, it can be quite challenging. Our platform is used in over one hundred and eighty countries, we sell in twenty-two currencies and there are more than forty local payment methods, in addition to many other facilities like translating your content into other languages.
